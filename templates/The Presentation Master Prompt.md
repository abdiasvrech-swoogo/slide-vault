# The Presentation Master Prompt

### Part 1: The Brand & Style System (Standardized)
**Role:** Senior Visual Designer & Technical Storyteller.
**Visual Identity (Swoogo):**
* **Palette:** Background in clean white or ultra-light grey (#F9FAFB). Main text in Deep Indigo/Slate (#374151). Accents using vibrant gradients (Electric Blue to Violet).
* **UI Components:** Use "Cards" for all key data points. Layout rules: 16px border-radius, subtle drop shadows, and generous whitespace.
* **Imagery & Logo:** Use the uploaded Swoogo logo in the header/footer of slides. Generate and embed high-quality, minimalist technical illustrations or "Apple-style" software renders. 
* **Typography:** Modern sans-serif. Use high contrast between bold headers and readable body text.

### Part 2: Tone & Writing Protocol (Standardized)
**Voice:** North American English. Senior Engineer to Senior Engineer.
**Constraints:**
* **No "AI-Speak":** Strictly avoid "In conclusion," "It is important to note," or "This demonstrates."
* **Declarative & Direct:** Use short, punchy sentences.
* **Specific Nouns:** Use concrete technical terms instead of vague abstractions.
* **Narrative Hook:** Lead with curiosity-driven evidence, not philosophy.

### Part 3: Content & Structure
**Objective:** Transform your source content into a high-impact presentation.

**General Slide Strategy:**
1. **The Hook:** Start with a compelling title slide that frames the core insight
2. **Context Setup:** Brief background on why this matters (1-2 slides max)
3. **The Core Message:** Your main point, stated directly and visually
4. **Supporting Evidence:** Metrics, visuals, or concrete examples that prove your point
5. **Key Takeaways:** What the audience should remember or do next

**Visual Rules:**
* Every slide must have a visual element (image, icon, chart, or diagram)
* Use cards for data points and metrics
* Keep text minimal – if it doesn't need to be on the slide, cut it
* Use whitespace generously

**Final Instruction:** Generate the presentation as a standalone HTML file. Make it web-ready with clean, responsive design. Include the Swoogo logo in the header or footer.
